# Teco Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn data to uncover patterns and propose strategies for improving customer retention. It focuses on behavioral, demographic, and contractual factors influencing churn decisions.

# Project Overview
 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed raw customer data using Pandas, including handling missing values, label encoding, and feature selection.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized churn rates by contract types, tenure, payment methods, and internet service using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
 **Insights:**
    42% churn for month-to-month users; only 3% for two-year contracts
    50% churn for customers with <1 year tenure
    45% churn rate among electronic check users
 **Recommendations:** Promote long-term plans, optimize payment options, and improve early user engagement to reduce churn.
